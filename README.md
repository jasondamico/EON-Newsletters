# EON-Newsletters
 EON (entrepreneurship club) newsletter HTML files.

At Union, I am a part of EON: the Entrepreneurs of the Nott. As part of my involvement with the club, I am a contributer to the newsletters regularly sent to a group of subscribers. I also create the newsletters with HTML. I use a loose template generated from [htmlemail.io](http://htmlemail.io/), which I inhereted when I joined the newsletter team and took on coding responsibilities. This repository is home to all of the newsletters that I have created (with the exception of the second newsletter, which was built before I joined the team and is included as a reference).
